# fastfoodz

The goal of the assignment is to build a simple app that finds fast food places nearby in 4 popular categories: Burgers, Pizza, Mexican and Chinese. The app is using the user’s location and searches Yelp API to display them in two different views: on the map and in the list. When user selects a place, the app will display driving directions in another screen using Apple’s MapKit APIs.
